# OghalaiLabRibbonAnalysis
First project summer 2020
This was made for Ido's paper on ribbon locations in relation to nuclei. Please do not use for another project unless you have spoken to me, so I can make sure that the GUI has everything that you need(and you aren't mislead by some of the stuff)
You can talk to me through email to koghalai@usc.edu(if before 2024) or koghalai@gmail.com after that
